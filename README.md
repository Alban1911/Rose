## Overview

Rose is an open-source automatic skin changer for League of Legends that enables seamless access to all skins in the game. The application runs silently in the system tray and automatically detects skin selections during champion select, injecting the chosen skin when the game loads.

**Rose is built on two core technologies:**
- **🎮 Pengu Loader**: Plugin system that injects JavaScript plugins into the League Client, enabling enhanced UI interactions and skin detection
- **🔧 CSLOL**: Safe skin injection framework that handles the actual skin injection process, fully compatible with Riot Vanguard

These technologies work together to provide a seamless, automatic skin-changing experience without any manual intervention.

## Architecture

Rose consists of two main components:

### Python Backend
- **LCU API Integration**: Communicates with the League Client via the League Client Update (LCU) API
- **CSLOL Injection**: Uses CSLOL tools for safe skin injection
- **WebSocket Bridge**: Operates a WebSocket server for real-time communication with frontend plugins
- **Skin Management**: Downloads and manages skins from the [LeagueSkins repository](https://github.com/darkseal-org/lol-skins)
- **Game Monitoring**: Tracks game state, champion select phases, and loadout countdowns

### Pengu Loader Plugins
Rose includes a suite of JavaScript plugins that extend the League Client UI:

- **ROSE-UI**: Unlocks locked skin previews in champion select, enabling hover interactions on all skins
- **ROSE-SkinMonitor**: Monitors skin hover events and sends them to the Python backend via WebSocket
- **ROSE-ChromaWheel**: Enhanced chroma selection interface for choosing any chroma variant
- **ROSE-SettingsPanel**: In-client settings panel accessible from the League Client UI
- **ROSE-RandomSkin**: Random skin selection feature
- **ROSE-HistoricMode**: Access to historic and legacy skin variants

## How It Works

1. **League Client Integration**: Rose activates **Pengu Loader** on startup, which injects the JavaScript plugins into the League Client
2. **Skin Detection**: When you hover over a skin in champion select, `ROSE-SkinMonitor` detects the selection and sends it to the Python backend
3. **Skin Preparation**: The backend downloads the skin (if needed) from the LeagueSkins repository and prepares it for injection
4. **Game Injection**: Using CSLOL tools, Rose injects the selected skin when the game loads, suspending the game process temporarily during injection
5. **Seamless Experience**: The skin loads as if you owned it, with full chroma support and no gameplay impact

## Features

- **Automatic Skin Detection**: Detects skin selections through hover events in champion select
- **All Skins Accessible**: Access to every skin for every champion
- **Chroma Support**: Select any chroma variant through the enhanced UI
- **Random Skin Mode**: Automatically select random skins
- **Historic Mode**: Access legacy and historic skin variants
- **Smart Injection**: Never injects skins you already own
- **Safe & Compatible**: Uses CSLOL injection tools compatible with Riot Vanguard
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with any client language
- **Open Source**: Fully open source and extensible

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11**
- **Python 3.11+** (for development)
- **League of Legends** installed
- **Administrator privileges** (required for skin injection)
